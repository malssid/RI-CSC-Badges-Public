# RI-CSC-Badges-Public

This project was made for the Rhode Island Department of Education to prototype how a badging program would work for K-12 Computer Science students in the state. The script uses Google forms to retrieve submissions, Google sheets as a database and pandas to manipulate the data. Badgr is an open source digital badge platform and it's used in the project as the "backend" to store these badges.
